# Playlist-Manager
This is a C++ Program which manages a playlist of songs. The PlayList class manages a dynamically allocated array of song objects. The song class is provided for you in song.h and song.cpp, which should NOT be modified. Your playlist class will be implemented in two files proj5_playlist.h and proj5_playlist.cpp. The class will support two basic functions: Managing the playlist. This includes adding and deleting songs. Playing from the play list. This includes keeping track of which is the next song to be played. Obviously we will not actually be playing any music. “Playing” the song will consist of printing the name.
